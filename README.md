# Symphoprobe
Probes audio files using the
[Symphonia](https://crates.io/crates/symphonia) crate.

The **only point** of this program is to help me understand what Symphonia
can see when I pass it an audio file and what I can do with that information.

If you think you might want to use Symphoprobe in your everyday life and aren't
using Symphonia in any of your projects, ***you should use
[ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) instead***. It 
[comes bundled with ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), which means it's
free, plus it's orders of magnitude more versatile than my little program here.
